/*
exercise 9-3. Write a function template plus() that takes two arguments of potentially
different types and returns a value equal to the sum of both arguments. Next, make
sure that plus() can be used as well to add the values pointed to by two given
pointers.
extra: Can you now make it so that you can also concatenate two string literals using
plus()? Warning: This may not be as easy as you think!
