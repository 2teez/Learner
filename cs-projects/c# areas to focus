Your C# code demonstrates a good understanding of several intermediate-to-advanced programming concepts, including:

OOP Principles: Use of classes, constructors, properties, and inheritance.
Extension Methods: Useful for enhancing functionality.
File I/O: Reading and writing to files using StreamReader and StreamWriter.
Regex Usage: Implementing pattern matching for dynamic behavior.
String Manipulation: Proficiency with StringBuilder and string formatting.

AREAS TO FOCUS
==============

To prepare for a job using C#, here's what you should focus on next:

Core Areas to Master
.NET Framework and .NET Core/5/6+

Learn how to work with .NET Core/6+, as it's the modern approach.
Understand project structures, dependency injection, and configuration.
Asynchronous Programming

Dive deeper into async/await.
Learn about Task, ValueTask, and the IAsyncEnumerable interface.
LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

Practice complex LINQ queries, including joins, grouping, and projections.
Work with LINQ in collections and databases.
Error Handling and Logging

Improve your understanding of exception handling patterns.
Learn to use logging frameworks like Serilog, NLog, or the built-in .NET logging.
Unit Testing

Get comfortable with testing frameworks like NUnit, xUnit, or MSTest.
Understand mocking libraries such as Moq for isolating dependencies in tests.
Web Development
ASP.NET Core

Learn to build APIs with ASP.NET Core (focus on REST principles).
Understand Razor Pages, MVC pattern, and Blazor for building web UIs.
Entity Framework Core

Master database interaction using Entity Framework Core.
Learn migrations, LINQ-to-SQL, and best practices for performance.
Authentication & Authorization

Learn how to implement identity management using ASP.NET Identity.
Explore OAuth2, JWTs, and securing APIs.
Advanced Topics
Design Patterns

Understand and apply common patterns like Singleton, Factory, Repository, and Dependency Injection.
Memory Management

Learn about garbage collection and unsafe code for low-level memory access (when necessary).
Interoperability

Practice interop with native libraries or COM objects if relevant to your target industry.
Tooling and Ecosystem
Version Control

Deepen your Git skills (branches, merges, rebasing, pull requests).
Build Tools

Learn about MSBuild, project file properties, and CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).
Debugging and Profiling

Master debugging tools in Visual Studio.
Use profiling tools like dotTrace or dotMemory to analyze performance.
Soft Skills and Professional Development
Code Reviews

Practice giving and receiving constructive feedback.
Collaboration

Work on team projects, understanding how to divide tasks and integrate features.
Project-Based Learning

Build portfolio projects to showcase your skills (e.g., a blog, e-commerce app, or task manager).
Suggested Roadmap
Short Term (1–2 Months):

Master async/await and LINQ.
Build a small API with ASP.NET Core.
Mid-Term (3–6 Months):

Create a project involving a front end (Blazor or React) and a back end (ASP.NET Core API with EF Core).
Practice testing and deploy your app using CI/CD pipelines.
Long Term (6+ Months):

Gain proficiency in advanced design patterns, authentication, and performance tuning.
